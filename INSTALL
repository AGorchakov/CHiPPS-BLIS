**********************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the Alps package in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended).  For this you needs the program 'svn' installed on
   your machine, and output of "svn --version" must contain 
   "handles 'https' scheme".

   Assuming that you want to download stable vesion 0.6 into a subdirectory
   "Blis-0.6", you type

   svn checkout https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Cops/Blis/stable/0.6 Blis-0.6

2. Download the tarball from http://www.coin-or.org/Tarballs/Cops


   More detailed download instructions can be found at

***      CONFIGURATION, COMPILE, INSTALLATION                      ***
**********************************************************************

1. Serial Solver
----------------

Go into the directory that you just downloaded or extracted (e.g. Blis-0.6),
then you type following commands:

  1) ./configure
  2) make
  3) make test
  4) make install 

Then, go to Blis-0.6/Blis/example
  5) make

Step 5) creates an excutable blis that you can run as

  ./blis -par blis.par


2. Parallel Solver (MPI as message passing interface) 
-----------------------------------------------------

Configure and compile MPI parallel solver is system depend. User have to
specify options --with-mpi-incdir, --with-mpi-lib, MPICC, and MPICXX.
Following is an example.

Go into the directory that you just downloaded or extracted (e.g. Blis-0.6),
type

  1) ./configure --enable-debug --with-mpi-incdir=/home/yanxu1/src/mpich/include --with-mpi-lib='-L/home/yanxu1/src/mpich/lib  -lmpich -lpthread -lrt' MPICC=mpicc MPICXX=mpiCC
  2) make 
  3) make install

Then, go to Blis-0.6/Blis/example
  4) make

Step 4) creates an executable blis that you can issue mpirun like 
(assume MPICH)

  mpirun -np 8 -machinefile machines ./blis -par blis.par



You might want to specify other options, in case you don't want to 
use the default choices that configure makes (e.g., compilers).
